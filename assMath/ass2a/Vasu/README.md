1. I tried with latex but I learnt it first time while doing this assignment so it wass bit dfficult to write as it was very complicated.
   From next time, I'll write the mathematical part in Latex Only. For now, I've attached the maths part in a pdf file and code part in .ipynb file.
2. BONUS Qn is not done yet.
