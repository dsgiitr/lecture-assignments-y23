### Overview of Script
The script inputs the various file paths and parameters to apply random forest classifier on the data. It assumes the presence of a 'target' column in the training dataset which is to be predicted for the testing dataset. Further it plots a seaborn pairplot for the data which runs parallel to the classification.
